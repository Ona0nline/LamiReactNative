# Lami (React Native)

Lami is the mobile frontend of a ride-sharing application I’m building to practice and showcase full-stack development. The project is built with React Native and integrates with a Spring Boot backend, focusing on creating a seamless and scalable user experience.

## ✨ Features

* User authentication and profile management
* Ride request and booking interface
* Real-time updates from backend REST APIs
* Clean and responsive UI built with React Native
* Modular code structure for scalability

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Frontend: React Native, JavaScript
* Tools: IntelliJ, Expo Go

## 📐 Design

The user interface is guided by my Figma prototype. The design prioritizes ease of understanding, accessibility, and simplicity, while following a familiar ride-sharing flow and leaving room for iteration.

## 🚀 Current Progress
Basic API endpoints are fully functional (authentication). Mobile screens are connected to the backend and returning live data.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
Through Lami, I’m sharpening my skills in:

**Building cross-platform apps with React Native**

**API integration and handling asynchronous data**

**Designing scalable, modular backend-frontend architecture**

**Creating real-world applications from concept to deployment**

👉 Future updates will include: driver tracking, payment integration, and more polished UI.
